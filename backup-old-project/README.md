# K3S Secure Kubernetes Cluster on AWS (Terraform)

This is a beginner-to-intermediate DevOps project where I used Terraform to deploy a secure single-node K3s Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

The project creates:
- A VPC (network)
- A bastion host (for secure access)
- A K3s server (private subnet)
- Automated scripts to install Kubernetes and export kubeconfig

This is part of my DevOps learning journey and portfolio.
